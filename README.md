## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate and motivated IT student currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree at Belgium Campus. I’m deeply interested in technology and problem-solving, with a strong commitment to excellence—evidenced by the academic distinctions I’ve earned along the way.

Whether I’m building educational tools in C# or tutoring young learners in mathematics, I bring energy, leadership, and a love for continuous learning. My goal is to build real-world tech solutions that make a positive impact.

Outside of tech, I find creativity and balance through music 🎶.
